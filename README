This are just a few bash binaries for easying my tasks while building debian
packages with git while using this structure:

* experimental
 * upstream-experimental
 * master-experimental
* unstable
 * upstream
 * master
* backports
 * upstream-backports
 * master-backports

There's included too the gbp.conf file that I use to complete the building using pdebuild instead of debuild (for sanity check).

INSTALLING
==============

Just run ./install.sh, that script will make symlinks from this directory
to ~/bin and will symlink gbp.conf in ~/.gbp.conf as well.

Not real installing since is yet pre-alpha.
